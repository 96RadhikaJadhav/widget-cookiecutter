A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for a custom
Jupyter widget project.

## What is widget-cookiecutter?

With **widget-cookiecutter** you can create a custom Jupyter interactive
widget project with sensible defaults. widget-cookiecutter helps custom widget
authors get started with best practices for the packaging and distribution
of a custom Jupyter interactive widget library.

## Who uses widget-cookiecutter

Popular widget libraries such as
[bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot),
[pythreejs](https://github.com/jovyan/pythreejs) and
[ipyleaflet](https://github.com/ellisonbg/ipyleaflet)
 can serve as advanced examples of usage of the
Jupyter widget infrastructure.

## Usage

Install [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter):

    $ pip install cookiecutter

After installing cookiecutter, use the widget-cookiecutter:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyter/widget-cookiecutter.git

As widget-cookiecutter runs, you will be asked for basic information about
your custom Jupyter widget project. You will be prompted for the following
information:

- `author_name`: your name or the name of your organization,
- `author_email`: your project's contact email,
- `github_project_name`: name of your custom Jupyter widget's GitHub repository,
- `github_organization_name`: name of your custom Jupyter widget's GitHub user or organization,
- `python_package_name`: name of the Python "backend" package used in your custom widget.
- `npm_package_name`: name for the npm "frontend" package holding the JavaScript
  implementation used in your custom widget.
- `project_short_description` : a short description for your project that will
  be used for both the "backend" and "frontend" packages.
  
After this, you will have a directory containing files used for creating a
custom Jupyter widget. You will now be able to easily package and distribute
your custom Jupyter widget.

## Files Generated by cookiecutter
Jupyter widgets are made of two separate programs:
- Python package for the code executed in kernel as the backend of the widget
- Javascript package for the frontend of the widget running in browser

This cookiecutter generates both example source files for both the backend and frontend programs, as well as the tooling to make the widget work in both the classic notebook, JupyterLab and in stand-alone HTML pages.

```

- **`<python_package_name> directory`**\
This directory contains the python package that runs in the kernel

    - **`__init__.py`**\
Marks the `<python_package_name>` directory as a python module, allowing `<python_package_name>` to be imported as a module

    - **`_version.py`**\
Contains python module version definitions

    - **`example.py`**\
Definition of Python interface to the widget. This file defines the Python interface, and which parts of the data are synced to the frontend.

- **`js directory`**\
Source files for widget frontend. This gets transpiled and bundled using webpack. Webpack will create three different code bundles:

    1. one that is suitable for loading the widget frontend in the Classic Notebook
    2. one that is suitable for loading the widget frontend in JupyterLab
    3. one that is suitable for loading the widget frontend in standalone HTML webpages with no backend

    - **`lib directory`**\
Directory containing source files

        - **`embed.js`**\
Webpack entry-point for generating the code bundle that is loaded when widgets are used in a stand-alone HTML page. Learn more about embedding widgets into a stand-alone HTML page [here](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/embedding.html).

        - **`example.js`**\
Widget frontend source code. Contains widget model and view class definitions. Widget model is derived from [DOMWidgetModel](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/base/src/widget.ts) which provides functionality to communicate with the model instance on kernel. Widget view is derived from [DOMWidgetView](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/packages/base/src/widget.ts) which has a `model` attribute referencing to widget model it is presenting.

        - **`extension.js`**\
Webpack entry-point for generating the code bundle that is loaded when widgets are used in the classic notebook.

        - **`index.js`**\
This is the entrypoint to your library. When you add new widgets, or change widget names, add these here. index.js gets loaded by all the Webpack entrypoints.

        - **`labplugin.js`**\
JupyterLab extension definition for JupyterLab integration. When JpuyterLab loads, it activates the plugin defined in this file. Widget registry service provided by `@jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager` is used during activation to register the widget with JupyterLab.

    - **`package.json`**\
npm package definiton file for widget frontend

    - **`README.md`**\
Auto-generated documentation file for frontend npm package, with installation instructions.

    - **`webpack.config.js`**\
Webpack bundler configuration that defines bundler entry points and ouputs along with other configuration

- **`.gitignore`**\
Ignore rules for widget project git repository.

- **`<npm_package_name>.json`**\
This file gets copied into the configuration directory for the classic notebook as part of the installation process. This enables the extension for the notebook.

- **`MANIFEST.in`**\
setuptools configuration file containing commands to execute (include / exclude files) during installation (pip install).

- **`README.md`**\
Auto-generated documentation file for widget project.

- **`RELEASE.md`**\
Auto-generated documentation file for publishing python package to PyPI and npm package to npm registry.

- **`setup.cfg`**\
Configuration file to mark the python package as a Universal Wheel.

- **`setup.py`**\
Build script for the widget package.

## Local Dev Installation for Classic Notebook
- `pip install -e .` (installs python package for development, runs `npm install` and `npm run build`)
- `jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix <python_package_name>`\
(symlinks `static/` directory into `<jupyter path>/nbextensions/<extension_name>/`)
- `jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix <python_package_name>`\
(copies `<npm_package_name>.json` into  `<environment path>/etc/jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.d/` directory)
- `jupyter labextension install js`
- After making python code changes
    - Restarting kernel will be enough to reflect changes
- After making javascript code changes
    - `cd js`
    - `npm run build`
    - Refresh browser to reflect changes

## Local Dev Installation for JupyterLab
- `pip install -e .` (installs python package for development, runs `npm install` and `npm run build`)
- `jupyter labextension install js`
- After making python code changes
    - Restarting kernel will be enough to reflect changes
- Run `jupyter lab --watch`, to have JupyterLab rebuild automatically to reflect widget frontend changes
- After making javascript code changes
    - `cd js`
    - `npm run build`
    - Refresh browser to reflect changes

## Publishing Widget
Follow the steps in (RELEASE.md) to publish widget python package and npm packages.

## Widget Installation Process for Notebook
When installing published package in non-development mode
- `pip install` installs python package for access from kernel and copies frontend code files from `static/` directory into `<jupyter path>/nbextensions/<extension_name>/` and enables by copying `<npm_package_name>.json` file into `<environment path>/etc/jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.d/` directory.

## Widget Load Process for Notebook
- Python code is loaded into kernel from python package directory
- Frontend javascript code loaded from `<jupyter path>/nbextensions/<extension_name>/extension.js`
